## Short Description

Manual, privacy-friendly debugging captures: screenshots, DOM, console, and network in one bundle.

## Detailed Description

DebugShot is a developer productivity tool that keeps your captures on-device. Activate it only on the tabs you choose, then collect the exact debugging evidence you need in seconds. Each capture downloads to your machine as a neatly organized folder—no cloud uploads, no background tracking.

### Why DebugShot?
- **On-demand activation** – stays idle until you turn it on for a tab.
- **Flexible capture options** – mix screenshots, DOM snippets, console logs, and network traces.
- **Area or full-page modes** – drag to highlight a region or capture the entire viewport.
- **JSON + PNG output** – share structured bug reports straight from your Downloads folder.
- **DevTools-aware** – integrates with Chrome DevTools for richer network logging when needed.

### Getting Started
1. Pin the DebugShot action icon.
2. Open the popup and activate it on your current tab.
3. Choose what to capture and click **Capture full tab** or **Capture area** (F10 / F9).
4. Find the exported folder inside `Downloads/debugshot/`.

### Permissions Explained
- **activeTab & scripting** – inject helpers only after you enable a tab.
- **downloads** – save captures locally.
- **storage** – remember your capture preferences.

DebugShot never uploads your data. Everything remains under your control.
