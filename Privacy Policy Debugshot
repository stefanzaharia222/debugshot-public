# DebugShot Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 30, 2025_

DebugShot helps you capture debugging assets directly inside Chrome. We take your privacy seriously and designed the extension so that all captured data stays on your device.

## Data We Collect

DebugShot captures only the information you explicitly request:

- Screenshots of the active tab (if selected)
- DOM element summaries in the capture selection
- Console messages and browser errors emitted after activation
- Network request metadata visible to the page

The extension does **not** collect or process any other personal information.

## How Data Is Used

- Captured data is packaged into PNG and JSON files saved in your browser's default downloads folder.
- The data never leaves your device. DebugShot does not transmit information to remote servers or third parties.
- Captured console and network buffers are cleared as soon as a capture completes or you deactivate the tab.

## Permissions Justification

- `activeTab` and `scripting`: required to inject capture helpers only after you explicitly activate the tab.
- `downloads`: used to save the capture bundles locally on your machine.
- `storage`: keeps your capture preferences (e.g., whether to include the DOM or console) inside Chrome storage.

## Manual Activation Controls

DebugShot stays inactive by default. You must turn it on per-tab using the popup. When you deactivate the tab—or navigate away—the extension removes injected listeners and stops collecting data.

## Third-Party Access

No third parties can access the data DebugShot captures. Everything is stored locally, and the extension has no analytics, remote logging, or cloud sync features.

## Changes To This Policy

We may update this policy if new features require different data handling. When that happens, we will update the "Last updated" date above and document the changes in the project repository.
